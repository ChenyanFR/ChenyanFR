I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about building **scalable cloud infrastructure** and creating full-stack applications that can handle real-world traffic. I work with both **AWS** and **GCP** to design cloud-native solutions, and I'm currently preparing to bring enterprise-level systems to production environments.

I believe in **Infrastructure as Code**, automated deployments, and making systems that don't wake you up at 3 AM. Let's build cloud architecture that scales effortlessly.

## 🎯 What I Do

- 💻 **Software Engineering**: Build full-stack applications with modern frameworks and best practices
- ☁️ **Multi-Cloud Architecture**: Design and deploy production-ready infrastructure on **AWS** and **GCP**
- 🔄 **DevOps & CI/CD**: Build automated pipelines that take code from commit to production with zero downtime
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform everything - VPCs, databases, compute, networking, security groups
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**: Set up comprehensive logging and metrics so you always know what's happening
- 🔐 **Security First**: Implement IAM best practices, encryption at rest and in transit, and proper network isolation
